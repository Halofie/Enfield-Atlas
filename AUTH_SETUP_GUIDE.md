# 🔐 Complete Authentication & Security Setup

## Current Status
✅ Firebase Auth initialized  
✅ Posts working (but insecure - anyone can post as anyone)  
❌ **CRITICAL**: Firestore rules need to be set for security  
❌ No login system yet

---

## 🎯 What We're Building

### 1. **Email/Password Authentication**
- Sign up with email, password, display name
- Sign in with existing account
- Persist auth state (stay logged in)
- Sign out

### 2. **Row Level Security (RLS)** 
- Users can only create posts as themselves
- Users can only edit/delete their own posts
- Everyone can read posts
- Everyone can like posts

### 3. **User Management**
- User profiles automatically created
- Display names shown on posts
- User avatars (future enhancement)

## 🚨 STEP 1: SET FIRESTORE SECURITY RULES (DO THIS NOW!)

### Go to Firebase Console:
1. https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: **pothole-maped**
3. Click **Firestore Database** → **Rules** tab
4. **REPLACE ALL RULES** with this:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Helper function - check if user is authenticated
    function isAuthenticated() {
      return request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Helper function - check if user owns the document
    function isOwner(userId) {
      return isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Journey Posts Collection
    match /journeyPosts/{postId} {
      // Anyone can read posts (public feed)
      allow read: if true;
      
      // Only authenticated users can create posts
      // AND they can only create posts as themselves
      allow create: if isAuthenticated() && 
                      request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      
      // Only post owner can update their posts
      // OR anyone can update likes/comments count (for engagement)
      allow update: if isOwner(resource.data.userId) ||
                      (isAuthenticated() && 
                       request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
                         .hasOnly(['likes', 'comments']));
      
      // Only post owner can delete their posts
      allow delete: if isOwner(resource.data.userId);
    }
    
    // User Profiles Collection (future)
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Anyone can read user profiles
      allow read: if true;
      
      // Users can only create/update their own profile
      allow create, update: if isOwner(userId);
      
      // Users can delete their own profile
      allow delete: if isOwner(userId);
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click **"Publish"** button
6. Wait for confirmation: "Rules published successfully"

## 🔑 What These Rules Do

### **Journey Posts Security**:
```
✅ CREATE: Must be logged in + can only post as yourself
   Example: User A (uid: abc123) can ONLY create posts with userId: "abc123"
   
✅ READ: Everyone can see all posts (public feed)
   
✅ UPDATE: 
   - Post owner can edit their post
   - Anyone can like/comment (updates only likes/comments fields)
   
✅ DELETE: Only post owner can delete their post
```

### **Protection Against**:
- ❌ Anonymous users posting
- ❌ Impersonation (posting as someone else)
- ❌ Editing other people's posts
- ❌ Deleting other people's posts

## 📱 STEP 2: Enable Firebase Authentication

### In Firebase Console:
1. Click **Authentication** in left sidebar
2. Click **"Get started"** (if not already enabled)
3. Click **"Sign-in method"** tab
4. Click **"Email/Password"**
5. **Enable** the toggle
6. Click **"Save"**

**That's it!** Your Firebase is now ready for authentication.

## 🎨 STEP 3: Test the New Auth System (Coming Next)

### I'm creating these components for you:

1. **Login/Signup Screen** (`components/auth/auth-screen.tsx`)
   - Beautiful UI with tabs for Sign In / Sign Up
   - Email + Password + Display Name fields
   - Form validation
   - Loading states
   - Error messages

2. **Auth Hook** (`hooks/use-auth.ts`)  
   - Already updated with Firebase Auth
   - Sign up, sign in, sign out functions
   - Auto-persists auth state
   - User info available app-wide

3. **Protected Home Screen** (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`)
   - Shows auth screen if not logged in
   - Shows journey feed if logged in
   - Posts created with actual user ID
   - User's name shown on their posts

---

## 🔄 How It Will Work

### **First Time User**:
```
1. Opens app → Sees "Sign Up" screen
2. Enters email, password, display name
3. Account created → Auto logged in
4. Now can create posts (with their name)
5. Posts saved with their user ID
```

### **Returning User**:
```
1. Opens app → Auto logged in (persisted)
2. Goes straight to journey feed
3. Can create posts, see their name
4. Can only edit/delete their own posts
```

### **Post Creation**:
```
Before: userId: "demo-user"  ❌ Insecure
After:  userId: "abc123xyz"  ✅ Real user ID from Firebase Auth
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Security (After Setup)

### Test 1: Anonymous User (SHOULD FAIL)
```
1. Sign out (or fresh install)
2. Try to create a post
3. Should see: "You must be logged in"
```

### Test 2: Authenticated User (SHOULD WORK)
```
1. Sign in
2. Create a post
3. Should work! Post has your real user ID
```

### Test 3: Edit Other's Post (SHOULD FAIL)
```
1. User A creates a post
2. Sign out, sign in as User B
3. Try to delete User A's post
4. Firebase blocks it: "Permission denied"
```

### Test 4: Like Any Post (SHOULD WORK)
```
1. Anyone can like any post
2. Likes increment
3. Post owner unchanged
```

---

## 📊 What Changes in Your App

### **Before (Current)**:
```typescript
// Anyone can post as "demo-user"
const userId = 'demo-user';  // ❌ Insecure!
const userName = 'Demo User';
```

### **After (Secure)**:
```typescript
// Only authenticated users with real IDs
const userId = user.uid;           // ✅ Real Firebase user ID
const userName = user.displayName; // ✅ Real user's name
```

### **Data in Firestore**:
```
journeyPosts/
  └── abc123/
      ├── userId: "firebase-uid-abc-123"  ← Real user ID
      ├── userName: "Varun"               ← Real name
      ├── routeName: "Chennai to Leh"
      └── ...
```

## 🎯 Summary of Steps

### RIGHT NOW - Set Security Rules:
1. ✅ Go to Firebase Console
2. ✅ Firestore Database → Rules tab
3. ✅ Copy/paste the rules above
4. ✅ Click "Publish"

### NEXT - Enable Email Auth:
5. ✅ Authentication → Sign-in method
6. ✅ Enable Email/Password
7. ✅ Save

### THEN - I'll Create:
8. 🔄 Login/Signup UI components
9. 🔄 Update home screen to check auth
10. 🔄 Update post creation to use real user ID
11. 🔄 Add sign out button
12. 🔄 Show user's name on their posts

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT

**DO STEPS 1-7 NOW** before I create the auth UI. The security rules are critical - without them, your database is wide open!

Once you've set the rules, let me know and I'll create the beautiful login/signup screen and connect everything! 🚀

## Questions?

- **"Will existing posts break?"** → No, they'll still show. New posts will have real user IDs.
- **"Can I still test without logging in?"** → No, security rules will require authentication.
- **"What if I forget my password?"** → I'll add password reset later.
- **"Can users have profiles?"** → Yes! The rules include a users collection for future profiles.
