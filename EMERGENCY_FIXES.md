# EMERGENCY ALERT FIXES - EXTREME MODE 🚨

## Issues Fixed

### ❌ Previous Problems:
1. **No Sound Playing** - Siren not audible
2. **Call Not Working** - Only opened phone app with number, didn't dial
3. **Weak Vibration** - Not intense enough to be noticed while driving

### ✅ What's Been Fixed:

## 1. LOUD AMBULANCE SIREN 🚨

### Multiple Redundant Sound Sources
Now tries **4 different emergency siren URLs** in sequence:
```
1. https://www.soundjay.com/misc/sounds/emergency-siren-1.mp3
2. https://www.soundjay.com/misc/sounds/emergency-siren-2.mp3
3. https://assets.mixkit.co/active_storage/sfx/2583/2583-preview.mp3
4. https://cdn.pixabay.com/audio/2022/03/10/audio_4d8b25d00f.mp3
```

If one fails, automatically tries the next until sound plays!

### Audio Configuration Enhanced
```javascript
Audio.setAudioModeAsync({
  playsInSilentModeIOS: true,        // ✅ Bypasses silent mode on iPhone
  staysActiveInBackground: true,      // ✅ Keeps playing in background
  shouldDuckAndroid: false,           // ✅ Does NOT lower volume for other apps
  allowsRecordingIOS: false,
  interruptionModeIOS: 2,             // ✅ Mixes with other sounds
  interruptionModeAndroid: 1,         // ✅ Dominates over other sounds
})
```

### Sound Settings
- **Volume**: 1.0 (MAXIMUM)
- **Looping**: true (continuous until "I'M OK" pressed)
- **Auto-play**: true (starts immediately)

## 2. INTENSE VIBRATION 📳

### Previous Pattern:
```javascript
Vibration.vibrate([500, 500], true);  // 500ms on, 500ms off
```

### NEW POWERFUL Pattern:
```javascript
Vibration.vibrate([1000, 300], true);  // 1000ms HARD vibration, 300ms pause
```

**This is MUCH more noticeable:**
- Longer vibration burst (1 second vs 0.5 seconds)
- Shorter pause (0.3 seconds vs 0.5 seconds)
- Creates urgent, attention-grabbing rhythm
- Works even with phone in pocket

## 3. AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY CALLING 📞

### Android - DIRECT DIALING (No User Action Required!)

**Uses Android Intent System:**
```javascript
intent:#Intent;action=android.intent.action.CALL;data=tel:112;end
```

This makes the phone **AUTOMATICALLY DIAL** the emergency number without user interaction!

**Requirements:**
- ✅ `CALL_PHONE` permission (already in app.json)
- ✅ Permission requested on first use
- ✅ Direct call placed after 40 seconds

**Fallback System:**
1. Try Android Intent (direct call)
2. If intent fails → Use `tel:` URL
3. If both fail → Show urgent alert with manual dial button

### iOS - One-Tap Calling
```javascript
tel:112
```
Opens phone app with number pre-filled (iOS requires one tap for security)

### Location-Based Emergency Numbers

Automatically detects your country and calls the correct number:
- 🇮🇳 India: **112** (Universal)
- 🇺🇸 USA: **911**
- 🇬🇧 UK: **999**
- 🇦🇺 Australia: **000**
- 🇨🇦 Canada: **911**
- 🇪🇺 EU: **112**
- 🇯🇵 Japan: **119**
- 🇨🇳 China: **120**
- 🇧🇷 Brazil: **192**
- 🌍 Default: **112** (International standard)

## How It Works Now

### Timeline:
```
0s  → 🚨 CRASH DETECTED!
      ✅ LOUD siren starts (ambulance sound)
      ✅ INTENSE vibration starts (1000ms bursts)
      ✅ GPS location detected
      ✅ Emergency number determined

5s  → 📍 Location shown: "Chennai, India"
      🔢 Emergency number: 112

40s → 📞 AUTOMATIC CALL PLACED
      ✅ Android: Direct call via Intent
      ✅ iOS: Phone app opens (tap to dial)
      🚨 Siren continues during call
      📳 Vibration continues
```

### User Actions:
- **Press "I'M OK"** → Everything stops (siren, vibration, countdown)
- **Wait 40 seconds** → Automatic emergency call
- **Press "Call Emergency Now"** → Immediate call (bypasses countdown)

## Alert Information Displayed

When emergency services are called, user sees:
```
🚨 EMERGENCY CALL ACTIVE

CALLING: 112
LOCATION: Chennai, India

📢 TELL THE OPERATOR:
"Vehicle crash detected at my GPS location"

CRASH DETAILS:
• Severity: SEVERE
• Impact Force: 3.2G
• My Location: Chennai, India

Stay on the line and follow operator instructions.
```

## Technical Details

### Permissions Required (Already Set in app.json):
```json
"permissions": [
  "VIBRATE",              // ✅ For intense vibration
  "MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS", // ✅ For max volume override
  "CALL_PHONE",           // ✅ For automatic calling
  "ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION",  // ✅ For GPS location
  "ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" // ✅ Backup location
]
```

### Sound Loading Strategy:
1. Try URL 1 → If success, use it
2. If URL 1 fails → Try URL 2
3. If URL 2 fails → Try URL 3
4. If URL 3 fails → Try URL 4
5. If all fail → Continue with vibration only

**Console logs show which URL worked!**

### Error Handling:
- Sound fails → Vibration continues
- Call fails → Show manual dial button
- Location fails → Use default 112
- All fails → Multiple fallback layers

## Testing the Features

### Test Sound:
1. Trigger crash detection
2. Check console: `✅ Emergency siren playing from: [URL]`
3. Should hear **LOUD ambulance siren**
4. Check if it plays even with phone on silent mode

### Test Vibration:
1. Trigger crash detection
2. Phone should vibrate **intensely** (1 second bursts)
3. Should feel much stronger than before
4. Check console: `📳 INTENSE VIBRATION STARTED`

### Test Auto-Calling (Android):
1. Trigger crash detection
2. Wait 40 seconds
3. **Phone should automatically dial 112/911**
4. Check console: `✅ Direct call initiated via Intent`
5. Call screen should open without touching phone!

### Test Auto-Calling (iOS):
1. Trigger crash detection
2. Wait 40 seconds
3. Phone app opens with emergency number
4. **Tap green call button** to complete call

### Test Location Detection:
1. Trigger crash detection
2. Check modal shows your city/country
3. Check correct emergency number for your location
4. Console shows: `🚨 Emergency number for IN: 112`

## Volume Notes ⚠️

**IMPORTANT**: The app plays sound at maximum volume (1.0) but the **actual loudness depends on your device volume settings**.

**Before Testing:**
1. Turn your device volume to **MAXIMUM** using volume buttons
2. Ensure device is **NOT on silent/vibrate mode**
3. Test in a quiet environment first

**The siren WILL play even in silent mode**, but the volume level is still controlled by the device's last volume setting before silent mode was enabled.

## Troubleshooting

### "No sound playing"
1. Check device volume is at maximum
2. Check console for: `✅ Emergency siren playing from: [URL]`
3. If no console message, check internet connection
4. Try waiting 2-3 seconds for sound to load

### "Call opens phone app but doesn't dial"
- **Android**: Make sure you granted `CALL_PHONE` permission
- **iOS**: This is expected behavior - iOS requires one tap for security
- Check console for permission status

### "Vibration not working"
1. Check `VIBRATE` permission granted
2. Check device settings allow vibration
3. Some devices have weak vibration motors
4. Console should show: `📳 INTENSE VIBRATION STARTED`

### "Wrong emergency number"
1. Check GPS location is enabled
2. Wait a few seconds for location detection
3. Console shows detected country and number
4. Fallback is always 112 (international)

## Code Changes Made

### Files Modified:
- `components/crash/emergency-alert-modal.tsx`

### Key Changes:
1. ✅ Multiple siren URLs with fallback logic
