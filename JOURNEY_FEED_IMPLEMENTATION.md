# Journey Feed Feature - Implementation Complete! üéâ

## Overview
Your home page has been transformed into a **social journey feed** (like Threads/Twitter) where users can share their travel experiences with route ratings and reviews!

## What's Been Created

### 1. **Type Definitions** (`types/journey.types.ts`)
- `JourneyPost`: Complete post structure with user info, route details, rating, review, metadata

## Database Structure

### Firestore Collection: `journeyPosts`
```
{
  id: auto-generated
  userId: "demo-user"
  userName: "Demo User"
  userAvatar: undefined (can be added later)
  routeName: "Morning Commute to Work"
  startLocation: "Home, 123 Main St"
  endLocation: "Office, 456 Business Ave"
  rating: 4
  review: "Great route with minimal traffic. Road conditions were excellent!"
  distance: "15 km"
  duration: "25 min"
  tags: []
  timestamp: Firebase Timestamp
  likes: 0
  comments: 0
}
```

## Current State

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- Journey post types
- Post card UI component
- Create post modal with full form
- Journey feed list component
- Firebase Firestore service
- Home page replaced with feed
- Floating "+" action button
- Like functionality
- Pull-to-refresh
- Infinite scroll
- Loading and empty states

### üîÑ **TO DO (Future)**
- Comment system (data structure ready)
- User authentication integration (re-enable Firebase Auth)
- User profiles and avatars
- Share functionality
- Tag filtering/search
- Post editing/deletion
- Notifications for likes/comments
- Image uploads for journey photos

## Testing Notes

### **Important**: User is currently "Demo User"
Since Firebase Auth is temporarily disabled, all posts are created by:
- `userId`: "demo-user"
- `userName`: "Demo User"

When authentication is re-enabled, this will automatically use:
- Real user ID from Firebase Auth
- Real user name from user profile

### **Firebase Firestore**
Make sure Firestore is properly configured in `config/firebase.config.ts`:
```typescript
export const db = getFirestore(app);
```

### **Testing Steps**
1. Navigate to Home tab
2. Should see empty state (if no posts)
3. Tap "+" button
4. Fill form and create a post
5. Should see post appear in feed
6. Test pull-to-refresh
7. Test like button
8. Create multiple posts to test scrolling
